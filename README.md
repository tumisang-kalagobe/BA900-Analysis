# BA900-Analysis

A program that extracts bank balance sheet data and presents it in a clear and visually appealing manner in order to compare and draw conclusions on the asset management practises of the banks in South Africa. The key information extracted is as follows:

- Bank name
- Branch code 
- Deposits
- Loans 
- Loan-to-deposit ratio
- Total assets 
- Total liablities

The data is found on the South African Reserve Bank's [website](https://www.resbank.co.za/Research/Statistics/Pages/Banks-BA900-Economic-Returns.aspx). It is downloaded manually from the website and added to the  "BA900" folder. Future edits would allow for automatic downloading and extraction of the tables directly from the website.

There is a handy user interface that allows the user to select the banks of interest, along with the time periods of interest. Futher updates are pending on that front.

*Disclaimer: this was my first attempt at object oriented programming and this project was completed in roughly a week*
